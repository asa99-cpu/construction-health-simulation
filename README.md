# Construction Health Simulation

This project simulates the long-term health effects of emissions from construction materials, focusing on concrete blocks used in houses in Iraq/Kurdistan.

## Features
- Analyzes material properties (emission rates, toxicity scores).
- Simulates cumulative health risks over a defined period (e.g., 20 years).
- Visualizes health risk trends.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
